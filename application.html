                            Food additives are any of various chemical substances added to foods to produce specific desirable effects. Additives such as salt, spices, and sulfite have been used since ancient times to preserve foods and make them more palatable. With the increased processing of foods in the 21st century, there comes a need for both the greater use of and new types of food additives.

                            Among all types of chemical that are used in foods these days, not all of them are bad for you. Some chemicals in foods are actually good and can give benefits for your health even though the name of these chemicals might scare you at first. In fact, many modern products, such as low-calorie, snack, and ready-to-eat convenience foods, would not be possible without food additives.
                          </p>
                          <p>Here we take some examples.</p>
                          <p>
                            Citric acid is used in winemaking. When grapes or other vinifications are overripe and have insufficient acidity, citric acid can be used to adjust to prevent the wine from becoming thinner. Citric acid is added to these juices, and also contains antioxidants and protective pigments to protect the freshness of the juice and prevent discoloration.</p>
                           <p>
                            Also, 2-Ethylhexanol is an organic compound with a molecular formula of C8H18O. Even though it has a non-natural source, it’s found in fruits such as cassava, raw and roasted earth almonds, raw beef and duck meat. As an allowable edible spice, it is also often used in baked foods, frozen dairy products and puddings
